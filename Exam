You are using Cloud Pub/Sub to stream inventory updates from many point-of-sale (POS) terminals into BigQuery. Each update event has the following information: product identifier "prodSku", change increment "quantityDelta", POS identification "termId", and "messageId" which is created for each push attempt from the terminal. During a network outage, you discovered that duplicated messages were sent, causing the inventory system to over-count the changes. You determine that the terminal application has design problems and may send the same event more than once during push retries. You want to ensure that the inventory update is accurate. What should you do?
A. Inspect the "publishTime" of each message. Make sure that messages whose "publishTime" values match rows in the BigQuery table are discarded.
B. Inspect the "messageId" of each message. Make sure that any messages whose "messageId" values match corresponding rows in the BigQuery table are discarded.
C. Instead of specifying a change increment for "quantityDelta", always use the derived inventory value after the increment has been applied. Name the new attribute "adjustedQuantity".
D. Add another attribute orderId to the message payload to mark the unique check-out order across all terminals. Make sure that messages whose "orderId" and "prodSku" values match corresponding rows in the BigQuery table are discarded.


You designed a database for patient records as a pilot project to cover a few hundred patients in three clinics. Your design used a single database table to represent all patients and their visits, and you used self-joins to generate reports. The server resource utilization was at 50%.

You can no longer run the reports, because they either take too long or they encounter errors with insufficient compute resources. How should you adjust the database design?
A. Add capacity (memory and disk space) to the database server by the order of 200.
B. Shard the tables into smaller ones based on date ranges, and only generate reports with pre-specified date ranges.
C. Normalize the master patient-record table into the patients table and the visits table, and create other necessary tables to avoid self-join.
D. Partition the table into smaller tables, with one for each clinic. Run queries against the smaller table pairs, and use unions for consolidated reports.
